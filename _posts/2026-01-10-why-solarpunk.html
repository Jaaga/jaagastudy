title: Why Solarpunk?
tags: [Philosophy, Aesthetic]

<p>In a world saturated with Cyberpunk aesthetics—neon, rain, decay, and high-tech low-life—we choose a
    different path. Solarpunk is not just an aesthetic; it is a proposal.</p>

<h2>High Tech, High Nature</h2>
<p>Solarpunk imagines a future where technology solves problems rather than creating them. It envisions
    a world where we have mastered energy, where cities are green, and where the future looks like a
    place you actually want to live in.</p>

<h2>Optimism as Rebellion</h2>
<p>It is easy to be cynical. It is easy to watch 'Black Mirror' and nod along. It takes courage to
    imagine a world that works. At Jaaga Study, we align with the Solarpunk ethos because we believe
    builder's must be optimists. You cannot build a future you cannot imagine.</p>

    "The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." — William Gibson

<p>Our goal is to distribute that future a little more evenly, one project at a time.</p>
