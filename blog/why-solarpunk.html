            <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Why Solarpunk?</h1>

            <p>In a world saturated with Cyberpunk aesthetics—neon, rain, decay, and high-tech low-life—we choose a
                different path. Solarpunk is not just an aesthetic; it is a proposal.</p>

            <h2>High Tech, High Nature</h2>
            <p>Solarpunk imagines a future where technology solves problems rather than creating them. It envisions
                a world where we have mastered energy, where cities are green, and where the future looks like a
                place you actually want to live in.</p>

            <h2>Optimism as Rebellion</h2>
            <p>It is easy to be cynical. It is easy to watch 'Black Mirror' and nod along. It takes courage to
                imagine a world that works. At Jaaga Study, we align with the Solarpunk ethos because we believe
                builder's must be optimists. You cannot build a future you cannot imagine.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Our goal is to distribute that future a little more evenly, one project at a time.</p>
