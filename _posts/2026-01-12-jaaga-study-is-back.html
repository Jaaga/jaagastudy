<p>We are thrilled to launch the first cohort of the Creative AI Bootcamp. This 9-week experiment
    brings
    together artists, coders, and dreamers to explore the edges of generative technology.</p>

<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>The tools for creation are changing faster than ever. We believe the best way to understand this
    shift is not by reading about it, but by building with it. This cohort is designed to be a
    sandbox—a
    place to mess around, break things, and find new workflows.</p>

<h2>The Structure</h2>
<p>We have divided the program into three key phases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ideas Week:</strong> Just vibing and finding the right problems to solve.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill Sprint:</strong> Deep diving into Eden.Art, ComfyUI, and Agentic workflows.
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Build:</strong> Creating a final project that says something new.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in joining us, applications are open until Jan 18th.</p>
